I am a PhD candidate in civil and environmental engineering at the University of New Hampshire and an ORISE Graduate Research Fellow at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Coastal Hydraulics Laboratory. My research focuses on quantifying effects of floods and flood risk management activities that are typically excluded from project planning efforts. Specifically, my research focuses on estimating the greenhouse gas emissions associated with damages caused by flooding events and the emissions associated with the implementation of flood risk mitigation projects. Through my ORISE fellowship, I am also working on research to estimate the health impacts of floods and develop methods to incorporate such estimates into the USACE planning framework.
