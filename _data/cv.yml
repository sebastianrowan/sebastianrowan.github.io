        I am Ph.D. candidate in civil and environmental engineering researching the impacts of flood events and climate change on people and communities. The goal of my research, is to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the risks posed by floods to enable the development of mitigation efforts that prioritize long-term sustainability and community well-being rather than maximizing financial return on investment.
