Abstract: Floods and storms are the most frequent and devastating natural hazards worldwide and are increasingly so due to climate change. Activities to repair damages caused by floods and implement mitigation projects result in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to climate change. To develop sustainable flood risk management strategies, there is a need to quantify these emissions. The purpose of this research project is to estimate the GHG emissions resulting from flood damage to residential structures. We use previously published data gathered from homeowner interviews and expert panels to develop component-level fragility curves and replacement cost estimates for structural and content items for multiple residential structure types. We performed a Monte Carlo analysis to estimate replacement costs for components damaged by floods across a range of depths. We used the USEPA's Environmentally Extended Input-Output (USEEIO) LCIA model to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions associated with damages in each simulation. Replacement costs for each component were mapped to an industry code in the USEEIO Model and formatted as a demand vector for input to the LCIA model. Results of the Monte Carlo analyses are aggregated to develop probability distributions of the GHG emissions from flood damages as a function of flood depths for each structure type. These tools will allow planners to include greenhouse gas emissions in cost-benefit analyses for flood risk management projects and consider a wider variety of alternatives such as nature-based infrastructure.
